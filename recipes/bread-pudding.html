            <h4>Simple Bread Pudding</h4>
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>2 cups milk</li>
                <li>2 tablespoons (¼ stick) unsalted butter, more for greasing pan</li>
                <li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
                <li>⅓ cup sugar</li>
                <li>Pinch salt</li>
                <li>½ loaf sweet egg bread like challah or brioche, cut into 2-inch cubes (about 5 to 6 cups)</li>
                <li>2 eggs, beaten</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Steps</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Heat oven to 350 degrees. In a small saucepan over low heat, warm milk, butter, vanilla, sugar and salt. Continue cooking just until butter melts; cool. Meanwhile, butter a 4-to-6-cup baking dish and fill it with cubed bread.</li>
                <li>Add eggs to cooled milk mixture and whisk; pour mixture over bread. Bake for 30 to 45 minutes, or until custard is set but still a little wobbly and edges of bread have browned. Serve warm or at room temperature.</li>
